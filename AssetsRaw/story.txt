Once upon a time, there was a cute little boy living with his mother.
But, suddenly one day, the little boy was cursed by the evil.
He can't touch anything, or he'll be a bunch of candy.
Luckily, a good wizard gave him a magic rope.
The little boy was hanging in the air with the magic rope, so that he could no longer be a candy.
And the way to break the curse of evil is to gather all the stars in the sky.
So the little boy stepped on the road of self redemption.
